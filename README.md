## HTML Structure

- ### Create header h1 tag - RUN BUDDY

- The header writes the h1 tag and the RUN BUDDY heading.
- In the unordered list or list item element in the navigation, I attached a link to the wrong content to be displayed with a tag.
- Here, the things written with a tag will change color if the arrow is placed it.
- Declare a global variable and decorate it.

- #### Hero / Jumbotron
- I wrote a big hero section first.
- I wrote a hero-cta section add h2 tag heading and a p tag of paragraph.
- I wrote a hero form with a div tag.
- And an h3 theader and p tag and a paragraph.
- Then add the label input in the form and fill in the letters.
- Finally, I have made a click on the button and submit to get running.
- Here, the edges of the frame are broken and the box sharow and colors are decorated.


- #### What We Do
- Now, in the what we do section, we have written two div tags, a heading and a paragraph.

- The title "Meet The Trainers" is written with an h2 tag.
- For the three trainers, a picture of each trainer and their actions are described.

- ### Reach Out
- This is the reach out section.
- Here, there are two div tags, one is the header, and the other is the address related to the run byddy page, and a form where you can write a comment for him is written with an iframe tag and a google map.
- The edges of the frame are broken and the box shadow and colors are decorated.

- To make the entire Run Buddy page responsive, the media screen sizes have been carefully written with maximum width / mini width.
